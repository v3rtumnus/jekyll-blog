= Cookieless website analytics with Matomo and Jekyll

Recently, I felt the need to add analytics to my Blog because I want to get a feeling if someone is actually reading these articles or if they are only for my personal amusement. However, I don't want to bug my visitors with cookies, since my goal is not to collect personal data or any trackable information in this regard. Therefore, I decided to go with https://matomo.org/[Matomo^], since I used this before, and I also learned that it has an option to disable all cookies.

It has to be noted that, by disabling cookies, you also loose information for your analytics. It is not possible to identify unique visitors (since basically every page-view will be a unique visit), and you are not able to detect frequent visitors of your site. Apart from not bugging your visitors, there are other upsides to this approach:

* You don't need one of those nice cookie banners, you nowadays get on almost every website
* There is no need for a dedicated *Privacy* section in your imprint

So if you decide to choose this approach, I'll guide you through the setup of Matomo and also the process of disabling cookies and integrating it into a Jekyll site.

== Setting up Matomo and integrating into Jekyll

As for the setup, I won't go into too much detail and directly point to the relevant section in the official https://matomo.org/docs/installation/[documentation^]. The important thing to note is that you need the following things:

* Some sort of Webserver (Apache, Nginx, ...)
* A MySQL server, which is used to save the data from Matomo

After you finished the guide linked above, you should have a running Matomo installation using the default settings. Additionally, tracking code should be provided in the last screen of the installation wizard.

Now you can install the `jekyll-analytics` https://github.com/hendrikschneider/jekyll-analytics[plugin^] by adding the following to your `Gemfile`:

[source,shell]
-----------------
gem 'jekyll-analytics'
-----------------

Afterwards it will be downloaded the next time, the `bundle` command is issued. To activate it, the following lines are added in `config.yml`:

[source,shell]
-----------------
plugins:
  - jekyll-analytics
...
jekyll_analytics:
  Matomo:
    url: matomo.url.in.place
    siteId: "1234" //You will see this when logging into Matomo
-----------------

One important note regarding this plugin is that you need to set the environment to `production` for it to actually sent analytics data:

[source,shell]
-----------------
JEKYLL_ENV=production jekyll serve
-----------------

Now your Jekyll installation should be able to send analytics data to your Matomo server.

== Disable cookies in Matomo

To disable all cookies for every site in Matomo, go to _Administration_ -> _Privacy_ -> _Anonymize data_ and enable the checkbox _Force tracking without cookies_:

This is it! You successfully integrated Cookieless Matomo analytics into Jekyll.
