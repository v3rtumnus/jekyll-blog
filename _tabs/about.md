I am Michael, a Java developer residing in Vienna. I have developed software using Java more than half of my life, and I am still doing it with great passion. Additionally, I quite enjoy self hosting all kind of servers/tools on my VPS. So most of the content on this site will be dedicated to one of these two topics. 

The original idea for this blog was to publish documentation, which I write along my journey, to everyone if I feel that at least one other person could also benefit from it. This is basically the sole reason for this blog, which results in the fact that some articles are rather short (because there is not more to them) and also don't comply perfectly to SEO standards (because I don't want to make money with this).
